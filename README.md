# Hamster-Vs.-Squeaky-Toys Instructions

Note: You can press ESCAPE or exit the tab at any time to quit out of the game.
- Start by pressing a key.
- Once you are in the game, use the arrow keys or WASD to move around and avoid the flying squeaky toys.
- Your score goes up for every frame you are alive.
- Once your score reaches 300, you will get an extra life marked with the hamster on the top of the screen.
- If you die when you have the extra life, you will respawn at the center of the screen.
- If you die without the extra life, you will lose the game.
- Try and beat the high score and brag to your firends!

# Extra Notes

- Made in Python, all coding by me.
- The game is technically not done yet, expect a bug or two.
